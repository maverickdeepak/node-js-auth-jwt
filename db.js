I think as a coder and especially as a Project Manager, well and most of all as your friend, it is my responsibility to help you get rid of this kind of “stinking thinking”, yes now we have a term for it in the English language, “the human tendency to persistently engage with thoughts that do not serve us”, thanks to the psychologist, Albert Ellis",
